TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
==================
Until you add real photos, the website will use:
- The SVG logo (rcz-logo.svg) which is already created
- Placeholder images from placehold.co (will show automatically)

To add your images:
1. Take or collect the photos
2. Rename them exactly as listed above
3. Place them in this folder (assets/images/)
4. Refresh the website - images will update automatically!

Note: The website is fully functional even with placeholder images.
